```

# Introduction

In this post, we will install blogdown in R, install Hugo, and install a Hugo theme.  Note that you need to have R installed to follow along.  Any editor will do.


# Installation

In order to install and use blogdown, just enter the following code in the R terminal, or from within a script.

```{r}
install.packages("blogdown", repos = "https://cloud.r-project.org/")
library(blogdown)
```
Next, to install Hugo, simply enter the following: 


```{r}
blogdown::install_hugo(force=TRUE)
```


## Installing themes

Hugo has a huge number of [pre-configured themes.](https://themes.gohugo.io/) We note, you should select a Hugo theme that supports blogging, as there are a variety of themes that serve various functions.  There are many, many themes that are not included in that set of themes linked above.  This site uses [hugo-lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium). To install hugo-lithium, enter the following:

```{r}

blogdown::install_theme(theme = 'yihui/hugo-lithium', force=TRUE)
```


That's it!  You've now installed Blogdown, Hugo and a theme on your computer.  In the next post I will describe how to connect your site to Netlify.
