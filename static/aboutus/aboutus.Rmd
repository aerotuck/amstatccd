# What We Do

The ASA Committee on Career Development provides support and information about career decisions to ASA members. The committee is also charged with providing information to non-members who are considering a career in statistics.

# Who We Are

The CCD is comprised of nine members who serve three year staggered terms and are appointed by the ASA president. The CCD sponsors and co-sponsors workshops and sessions at the annual JSM each year to serve the needs of ASA members. The committee continually reviews other possibilities to support the membership and fulfill their mission.
